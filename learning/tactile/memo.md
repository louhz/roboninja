# we find that we need seperate right hand control policy based on the tactile input


# that is why we only take the output control for the first stage model of right arm, left hand and left arm



# take those information as priposceptive for the right hand control input along with the point cloud as the simulator initializaiton 
# and the tactile input 

# for the policy to train on the right hand control
